// MeshQuorumPartitionTests.swift

//
// P4 item 5 (plan §10.4): moderation under partition — the roster quorum.
//
// §10.4, verbatim, is what this file encodes:
//
//   Removal requires ⌊|roster|/2⌋ + 1 distinct signed votes (the proposal counts as the proposer's
//   vote; the target cannot vote), where roster is the *current merged derived roster* at
//   evaluation time. Votes are signed records referencing a proposal ID; a proposal expires 5
//   minutes after issuance. A completed removal becomes a permanent `SignedRemovalRecord` and
//   union-merges like any record; an incomplete proposal simply expires and leaves no trace in the
//   roster. Consequences: roster 4 → quorum 3 → a 2/2 split can moderate nobody; a 3/1 split can
//   remove the isolated member. Roster 2 → quorum 2 with the target abstaining → removal is
//   structurally impossible. After a departure shrinks roster 4 → 3, quorum drops to 2 and a
//   connected pair regains moderation power.
//
// Four claims are walled here, each one something a later item cannot cheaply re-derive:
//
// 1. **Quorum is the RECEIVER's arithmetic, on the MERGED roster.** A partition does not shrink the
//    derived roster (item 1), so a branch of two out of four is short of quorum however connected
//    it feels. The table below runs rosters 2–8 × partition shapes and checks both questions in
//    every cell: can this branch remove somebody inside it, and somebody outside it.
// 2. **No wall clock in the bytes decides anything.** Expiry is measured from the RECEIVER's own
//    first-seen instant on an injected clock. The signed `issuedAt` is only ever a *bound* (§10.3's
//    ±10 minutes), so a forged far-future stamp cannot extend a window and a forged far-past one
//    cannot kill a live proposal.
// 3. **An incomplete proposal leaves no trace.** Not a tombstone, not a sealed row, not a record —
//    the ledger's four record counts are identical before the proposal and after it expires, and
//    `MeshSessionContext` stays at schema 2 because nothing here is ever persisted.
// 4. **Two independent completions converge on ONE removal.** Three members of a branch each reach
//    quorum and each mint a record; the union deduplicates by member keeping the earliest, so the
//    merge needs no special case and no second ledger commit happens at the manager seam.
//
// Everything except the last suite is a **value test**: `MeshRemovalQuorum` takes its clock and its
// roster as parameters and verifies no signatures, so §10.4's whole arithmetic runs with no fabric,
// no store and no transport. The signature half is `MeshMembershipRecordVerifier`'s and is asserted
// separately, with really-signed proposals and votes.
