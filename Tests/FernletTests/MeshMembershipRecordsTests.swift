// MARK: - MeshMembershipRecordsTests

// P3 item 1: the pure membership model — signed records, their union-merge, and the derived roster
// `admitted − departed − removed` (plan §8.1, bounds §9).
//
// Everything in this file is a value computation: no store, no transport, no clock, no signature
// verification. That is the point. The three claims worth a wall here are the three that later
// items build on and cannot re-check cheaply:
//
// 1. **The roster is subtraction, and subtraction is permanent.** A departed member is out for the
//    life of the mesh; a later admission record for the same fingerprint does not bring them back.
// 2. **The merge is a semilattice** — commutative, associative, idempotent — *including its caps*,
//    which is the half that is easy to break: a cap applied per-merge instead of over the union
//    would make convergence depend on who connected first, and that failure only shows up as two
//    devices quietly disagreeing about who is in the room.
// 3. **Every bound in §9 is enforced without a trap.** Records past the cap are dropped by a rule
//    that is the same on every device (earliest wins), never by a crash and never by luck.
