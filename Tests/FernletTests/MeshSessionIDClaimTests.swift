// 2026-09-23 — a reviewer's note on 31fafd6. The `sid` in the QUIC channel introduction's hello is
// NOT in the signed transcript, and it is what resolves an inbound tunnel to the browsed
// advertisement it came from (`MeshLinkTable.key(advertisingSessionID:)`). Every advertisement's
// `sid` is public in its TXT record, so a verified peer — a member, or a stranger while the join
// doors are open — could claim an ABSENT member's `sid`, take that member's browsed key, and hold it
// until its own tunnel ended. The member's re-link was then refused as a duplicate of the
// claimant's tunnel, this device's dial to it was refused as "already connected", and the re-dial
// sweep passed it over because a live tunnel carried its `sid`. Signing the field would not help:
// nothing binds an advertisement to a key (the TXT withholds `fp` on purpose), so a signature would
// only prove the claimant chose the claim.
//
// What this device CAN verify is its own dial: a tunnel it opened to an advertisement's endpoint
// proves who answers there. The claims walled here:
//
//  1. A claim cannot take an advertisement a dial of this device's proved belongs to another key.
//  2. A claim never REFUSES a member because another key holds the advertisement its `sid` names:
//     the member keeps its own connection key and re-links.
//  3. The re-dial sweep trusts a proven owner over a claimed `sid`, so a claimant's tunnel carrying
//     the member's `sid` cannot keep the member from being re-dialed.
//  4. Honest paths do not move: a re-dial by the proven owner still lands on its advertisement,
//     and every rule falls back to what it did when nothing is proven.
//  5. The residual is stated, not implied: before any dial of this device's has proven who answers
//     an advertisement and while no tunnel holds it, a claimant can still name it first.
//  6. The proven-owner record is bounded by the endpoint cache, and the radio asks the table at all
//     three sites (the call sites are pinned by source needle: the session actor's framework half
//     is not reachable at tier 1).
//
// Nothing here opens a socket or sleeps: the table is a value type, and the session's half is driven
// through the same functions the radio calls.
