// P5 item 3 (plan §11, C13): the custody verbs — the chunk-set decisions the durable store shares
// with the in-memory reassembler, the delivery map it persists, and the evidence behind every
// `custodied` rung.
//
// Three claims are walled here:
//
// 1. **One decision, two forms (C13).** `MeshChunkAssembly` and `MeshRoutedStore` reach the same
//    verdict for the same inputs on BOTH doors — per-chunk admission and manifest binding — because
//    they call the same pure function. The differential drives identical event sequences through
//    both and compares value for value; item 2's own `MeshChunkAssemblyTests` pass unmodified beside
//    it, which is what makes the extraction a refactor rather than a rewrite.
// 2. **The delivery map round-trips through the ORIGIN'S SIGNED MANIFEST.** The destination set is
//    never stored, `departed` is never encoded and is refused on decode, and a restored target still
//    refuses a regression and a set mismatch.
// 3. **Every `custodied` rung is backed by stored evidence**, written in the same index write as the
//    rung it evidences — and the recorded custodian is the receipt's SIGNER, because there is no
//    other parameter that could disagree with it.
//
// Nothing here sleeps, and every instant is injected.
