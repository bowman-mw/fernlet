// P5 item 2 (plan §11): the receive-side reassembler.
//
// The claims walled here:
//
// 1. **Order independence is structural.** Forward, reverse and a fixed permutation all reassemble
//    to identical bytes, because chunks ride streams that are not ordered against each other or
//    against the control stream carrying the manifest.
// 2. **Every input gets a verdict, and a retransmission is a no-op rather than an error.** A
//    duplicate is `.duplicate` — including a copy that differs only in its 64-byte signature, which
//    is what an honest RE-MINT looks like under CryptoKit's hedged Ed25519 — a chunk with a
//    different signed transcript or payload at a taken index is `.conflictingChunk`; nothing is
//    silently dropped.
// 3. **Completion is impossible while unbound, and `.complete` is the whole-item hash check.**
//    Every index can be present and the answer still be `.notBound`; every chunk can be
//    individually consistent and the assembled blob still fail the manifest's content hash.
// 4. **Growth is bounded where it happens.** A chunk that would take the held bytes past the bound
//    size is `.sizeOverflow`; a wrong-length interior chunk is `.payloadLengthMismatch` bound AND
//    unbound; the per-chunk 256 KiB half of the assembly's structural bound is checked at the door
//    in the unbound branch too, not left to the verifier's precondition; and binding re-validates
//    what is already held without mutating anything.
//
// Pure: the assembler verifies no signature, so fixture chunks carrying the opaque signature drive
// the whole battery with no keychain, no clock and no disk.
