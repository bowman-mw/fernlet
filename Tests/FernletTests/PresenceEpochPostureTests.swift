// P9 item 2 pass 1 (Docs/Plan-ProximityKit-Network-Migration-2026-08-27.md §17.1): the presence
// radio's EPHEMERAL POSTURE as a tier-1 value — a fresh TLS identity and a randomized instance
// name per 900 s presence epoch, so two sightings 901 seconds apart are not linkable.
//
// The rotation table is the test. Over a table of instants (epoch start, mid, 899.999, 900,
// 900.001, 1800 and a wrap 100 000 epochs ahead) the name and the certificate are stable inside an
// epoch and BOTH change at every boundary; across two epochs nothing is derivable — no counter, no
// shared half, no length that encodes the epoch, and no byte that comes from the device. The two
// non-derivability claims that could otherwise only be argued probabilistically are made exactly,
// by holding the entropy fixed and showing the name does not move with the epoch, and by holding
// the epoch fixed and showing it does move with the entropy. A third exact claim covers the one
// field of the posture that is NOT random: the certificate's validity window is anchored to the
// epoch's START, so a device that switches presence on ten minutes in carries byte-identical
// `notBefore`/`notAfter` to one that rotated on the boundary, and cannot be picked out by them.
//
// Tier 1: no rig, no radio, no simulator, no clock — every instant is an injected `Date` and every
// random draw is an injected closure.
