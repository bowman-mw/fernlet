// P5 item 5 (plan §11): deriving a routed inventory from a real routed store.
//
// The claims here are the ones a wire golden cannot make: that each field comes off the store door
// the design names, that the two halves of the custody self-rule are both live, that nothing is
// silently dropped from the advertisement, and that the held-chunk bitmap is the EXACT set — a
// repaired hole shows up as a missing bit even when the count still matches another peer's.
//
// Every test that touches disk runs on its OWN scope (temp directory + `.test.` keychain service),
// so the shared-disk-root flake family gains no member. Nothing here sleeps or reads a wall clock.
