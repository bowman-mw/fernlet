// The deterministic in-memory transport fabric. `MockMultipeerTransport` beside it stays: it is a
// single-peer script for coordinator handshake tests and does its job. This is the other thing —
// a multi-endpoint medium with links that can be delayed, cut and healed on a clock a test owns,
// which is what plan §16.2's partition matrix needs and what a scripted single-peer mock cannot be
// bent into.
//
// The one rule that governs the whole file: **no wall-clock sleeps**. This repository has a
// documented flake family whose root cause was wait helpers with no deadline floor, and a partition
// suite that slept would reproduce it at scale. Time here only moves when `VirtualClock.advance`
// says so, so a scenario either completes deterministically or hangs visibly on the assertion —
// never intermittently, and never differently under CI load.

/// A clock a test owns outright: it reads whatever the test set, and work scheduled on it runs only
/// when the test advances past its due time.
///
/// Ordering is by due time, then by insertion, so two items due at the same instant fire in the
/// order they were scheduled. Work scheduled *during* an advance is honoured within the same
/// advance if it falls due inside the window — that is what lets a latency chain (send → deliver →
/// reply → deliver) settle in one call.
