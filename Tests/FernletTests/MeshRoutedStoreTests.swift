//
// P5 item 3 (plan §11, §19.5): the sealed routed-content store — its five-state load, its write
// token, its caps, and the one claim the whole item exists to make.
//
// The claims worth walling here are the ones a later item cannot cheaply re-check:
//
// 1. **A refusal is never an absence.** Three of the five states mean "the field may be full" and
//    NONE of them vends a write token, so a caller holding one structurally cannot overwrite —
//    which, for a store holding other people's ciphertext, is the difference between deferring and
//    destroying custody. D4 makes it live rather than theoretical on every shipping build.
// 2. **Durable before acknowledged (plan §3.6).** No `MeshCustodyReceipt` exists for anything a
//    restart would lose, because a receipt needs a `MeshCustodyDurabilityWitness` and only a
//    returned durable write mints one.
// 3. **The index is authoritative, one way.** Bytes we cannot authenticate are bytes we do not
//    have; bytes we could not read *right now* repair nothing at all.
// 4. **Bounded growth is refused by name at the writer doors and refused as CORRUPTION at rest** —
//    never clamped, because clamping a durable record away is a restart quietly losing acknowledged
//    state.
//
// Every test runs on its OWN scope (temp directory + `com.fernlet.mesh-routed.test.<uuid>` keychain
// service). `MeshRoutedStoreIsolationTests` is the grep-wall that keeps it that way.
